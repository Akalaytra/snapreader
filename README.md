snapreader
=======

snapreader is a delta extractor and merger for the dmsetup target snapshot.
Its a study purpose project, and can serve as base for many others crazy
projects involving extracting the differences between devices and merging it
back into the original device (if wanted).

Fork it and test it, theres some scripts included to facilitate testing, and
only one machine is required.

Have fun!!
